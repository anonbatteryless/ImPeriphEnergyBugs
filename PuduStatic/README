This branch was set up to run on linux mint with llvm-7 installed through apt.

-Makefile: read this to see the different flags you can set
-llvm_it.sh: script that compiles the pass, the app, libpacarana, and runs the
pass on the app
-inputs: inputs to the automated toggle insertion
-src: directory for llvm C++ files
  tasks.cpp is effectively the "main" file of this pass, start there and use ctags
  to find your way around.
  ...




To compile an app to work with the pacarana-pass, you need to make the following
changes in maker and the usual msp libraries:

-Makefile.gcc: get rid of -mlarge flags, they bring in MSP430X instructions that
clang can't handle
-Makefile.clang: get rid of -Ox flags-- they optimizations prevent our pass from
seeing what states peripherals are defined as.
-libmsp: in mem.h, redefine __nv as __attribute__((section(".persistent"))) ,
not __attribute__((section(".upper.rodata")))
