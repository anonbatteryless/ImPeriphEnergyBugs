These are the inputs that will be used by both the pass and the application.

As a result, these files do absolutely no good here!

thresholds.csv is used by the pass so it needs to be moved to the directory
where the pass will be run (usually something like bld/pacarana-pass/)

<periph>_table.h files need to be moved to a directory where the application can
find them. E.g. add them to a ./tables directory and then add a -I ./tables to
the makefile.
