This library contains basic code for initializing and reading from the LSM6DS3
module included on capybara and edbsat boards.

Because of its interactions with i2c and libmspware, there's a high probability
that this library will need to be compiled strictly with gcc, but so it goes.


Finally, this code is written based on a driver put together by A. Colin
(github.com/alexeicolin) and Brandon Lucia (github.com/blucia0a)
